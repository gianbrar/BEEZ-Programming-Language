## HISTORY
Well, when I was a youngin, I dreamt of creatin my own programming language from what I did in the Python and whatnots and then to the work in the mill I was thinking bout the worst thing I could make, which almost reminds me of the time in where I ate that toast with that jam on it, but Bobby said that the jam was poisioned so we thought that we shoul get ridda all the toast. So I tol him dat was the worst thing we could do (see it does reacharound back to the beginning now which also reminds me of that one act of Homestuck in which all the characters, who are trolls now, which I thought was strange at the time although it was ratiionalized later, had to perform a double mobius reacharound. Crazy stuff, eh?) but he said it were a good idea, and that's... who am I again?
## HIVES
Type in ^ followed by a hive type to declare a hive. Hives cannot be declared inside of functions and they cannot be declared twice.
Different hives provide different features. If one wishes to redefine their hive, they must work outside of the hive and destroy it through nonconventional means, as there is no actual way to destroy a hive.
### HIVE TYPES:
CELL: Acts as a singular instance of the program which can store a singular variable, function, and loop can be defined.
```
^CELL
```
Above declares a cell hive.
COMB: A version of the CELL type which allows for a predefined number of variables, functions, and loops.
```
^COMB > 4 <
```
Above declares a comb hive with 4 variables, 4 functions, and 4 loops. This exact amount must be met.
AMORTIZED COMB: A version of the COMB type that allows any number of functions and loops such as that they fall under its mathematic function for variables as seen [here.](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Amortization-Formula-1.png)
Where:
P = Amount of functions allowed
r= Rate of interest (-t^n)
t = Linecount
n = Amount of loops allowed
Æ¥ = Only acceptable amount of variables. Round if it's a decimal.

```
^AMORTIZED > 3 < 9 >

```
Above declares an amortized comb hive with a max of 3 functions, a max of 9 loops, and
